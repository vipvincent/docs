# Death Swap

Death Swap is a thrilling competitive game where teams are scattered across different parts of the world. Every 30 to 200 seconds, they randomly swap positions with other teams. The swap order is completely random. The player's only goal is to design traps so that the next team member teleported to that location won't survive. Through careful planning and layout, players must ensure their team is the last one standing, enjoying a heart-pounding survival challenge.

- Simple backpack setting interface
- Adjustable health
- Starting tools and armor
- Auto furnace
- Swap warning and invincibility
- Timed switching between survival/creative modes
- Language support for English and Chinese 
- Four Teams/At least two player/Unlimited player
