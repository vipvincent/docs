# Death Swap

Death Swap is a game. The distance between the teams is very far, and they are randomly swapped in 30-200 seconds. There is no fixed order between the teams, and the only thing the player has to do is to design traps. Killed the next player teleported here and was the last surviving team.

:::warning

Death Swap is recommended for installation in newly created worlds.  
If installed in an existing world, it will cause your equipment, items, or blocks to disappear, and more likely cause world damage.    
So if you still want to install in an existing world, make sure your world is backed up.  
I am not responsible for any damage to the world, software conflicts, or other problems that may result. The user is solely responsible.
