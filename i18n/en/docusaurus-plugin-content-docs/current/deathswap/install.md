# How to Install

:::warning
Death Swap is recommended for installation in newly created worlds.  
If installed in an existing world, it will cause your equipment, items, or blocks to disappear, and more likely cause world damage.    
So if you still want to install in an existing world, make sure your world is backed up.  
I am not responsible for any damage to the world, software conflicts, or other problems that may result. The user is solely responsible.   
:::

Data packs are placed in the `datapacks` folder under the world folder; mod are placed in the `mods` folder.

:::tip
Mod versions is the same as datapack, but it will automatically apply to all worlds, usually on servers.  
If you don't want to apply to all worlds, please use datapack.
